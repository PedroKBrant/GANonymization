# GANonymization: A GAN-based Face Anonymization Framework for Preserving Emotional Expressions

[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02143)]
[[Demo]()]


## Quick Start
The project was tested only with python version 3.8. Newer versions might work as well.

### Installation
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/hcmlab/GANonymization`.
2. Install using `setup.py`:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
or:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hcmlab/GANonymization
```

### Training
You can either download a pre-trained GANonymization model:
* [Trained for 25 epochs](https://mediastore.rz.uni-augsburg.de/get/NsLjQYey65/) (publication version)
* [Trained for 50 epochs](https://mediastore.rz.uni-augsburg.de/get/Sfle_etB1D/)

Or train the GANonymization model yourself:
```bash
python main.py train_pix2pix --data_dir <data directory> --log_dir <log directory> --models_dir <models directory> --output_dir <output directory> --dataset_name <name of the dataset>
```

### Anonymize
You can run the anonymization as followed:
```bash
python main.py anonymize_image --model_file <path to model file> --input_file <image file> --output_file <output file>
```
