We introduce GANonymization, a novel face anonymization framework with facial expression-preserving abilities.
Our approach is based on a high-level representation of a face which is synthesized into an anonymized version based on
a generative adversarial network (GAN).
The effectiveness of the approach was assessed by evaluating its performance in removing identifiable facial attributes
to increase the anonymity of the given individual face.
Additionally, the performance of preserving facial expressions was evaluated on several affect recognition datasets and
outperformed the state-of-the-art method in most categories.
Finally, our approach was analyzed for its ability to remove various facial traits, such as jewelry, hair color, and
multiple others. Here, it demonstrated reliable performance in removing these attributes.

## Quick Start

The project was tested only with python version 3.8. Newer versions might work as well.

### Installation

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/hcmlab/GANonymization`.
2. Install using `setup.py`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

or:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hcmlab/GANonymization
```

### Training

You can either download a pre-trained GANonymization model:

* [Trained for 25 epochs](https://mediastore.rz.uni-augsburg.de/get/NsLjQYey65/) (publication version)
* [Trained for 50 epochs](https://mediastore.rz.uni-augsburg.de/get/Sfle_etB1D/) (demo version)

Or train the GANonymization model yourself:

```bash
python main.py train_pix2pix --data_dir <data directory> --log_dir <log directory> --models_dir <models directory> --output_dir <output directory> --dataset_name <name of the dataset>
```

### Anonymize

You can run the anonymization as followed:

```bash
python main.py anonymize_image --model_file <path to model file> --input_file <image file> --output_file <output file>
```

One of the critical processes to address these concerns is data anonymization, which aims to protect individual privacy and prevent the release of sensitive information. This research focuses on the importance of face anonymization. Therefore, we introduce GANonymization, a novel face anonymization framework with facial expression-preserving abilities.
